# DIY stickers

A lot of people seem to have liked these stickers and I can't keep up with demand so if you want to print your own here is the artwork and the details.

My printer preference is Diginate - but your mileage may vary. Sticker Mule are another great option. I go for singles rather than sheets and matt rather than gloss (because - well - I'm Matt)

- Minimal Viable Bureacracy are 7cm x 5cm 
- Work In Public Service are 7cm x 4.5cm
- Be the Poo Umbrella are 7cm x 7cm
- Weeknotes are 6cm x 6cm

If you do print some it would lovely if you let me know via raising an 'Issue' :)
