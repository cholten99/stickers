# DIY stickers

A lot of people seem to have liked these stickers and I can't keep up with demand so if you want to print your own here is the artwork and the details.

My printer preference is Diginate - but your mileage may vary. Sticker Mule are another great option. I go for singles rather than sheets and matt rather than gloss (because - well - I'm Matt)
